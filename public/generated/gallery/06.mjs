    THREE.JS MODULE FUNCTION GUIDE

    BOOT / DATA / LOADING
    fovForAspect(aspect) - Widens vertical field-of-view on portrait screens so the corridor does
      not become visually narrow.
    pieceInfo(n) - Returns normalized project metadata for a one-based painting number.
    slugByNum(), numBySlug(), frameByNum() - Convert between data order, URL slug, and 3D frame.
    _svcForTag(tag) - Maps a project category to the nearest preselected service query parameter.
    updateLoader(v) - Synchronizes the numeric percentage and loader bar.
    randomSeed(seed) - Produces repeatable pseudo-random values for stable particle placement.
    createPlaceholderArtwork(index) - Draws a dark canvas texture if an artwork cannot load.
    safeUrl(path) - URL-encodes each path segment without destroying folder separators.
    sampleAccentColor(ctx,w,h) - Samples usable midtone/saturated pixels to derive artwork lighting.
    loadArtworkTexture(path,index) - Loads the desktop/mobile image, center-crops it to 4:5, configures
      filtering, extracts its accent, and resolves to a placeholder on error.

    SCENE CONSTRUCTION
    makeMatcapEnvironment() - Generates a RoomEnvironment reflection map for chrome materials.
    createGalleryArchitecture() - Builds floor/reflection, walls, ceiling, back wall, and entrance.
    addEntranceDetailing() - Adds foyer pillars, emissive bulbs, plaque, glow, and chrome plaque frame.
    buildEntranceFocalWash() / buildBackWallHalo() - Add soft depth cues at front and back.
    createTemperatureLight() - Adds the light whose colour and position follow walk progress.
    createLights() - Adds neutral hemisphere, key, fill, and subtle far-corridor lights.
    createTitleTexture(text) - Draws auto-fitted, manually letter-spaced plaque text to a texture.
    createArtworkFrame(texture,accent,index) - Positions a work, adds art shader, chrome frame, mat,
      halo, optional spotlight hardware, title plaque, and all per-frame metadata.
    highlightHero(group) - Restyles the last project as the larger back-wall centerpiece.
    build3DTrail() / spawnTrailParticle3D() - Allocate and emit the WebGL cursor-particle pool.
    createDustMotes() / createParticles() - Add foreground dust and stable corridor atmosphere.

    CAMERA / OVERLAYS / INPUT
    updateCameraFromScroll() - Converts normalized progress into the intro, two-wall corridor walk,
      and midpoint turn; it also applies pointer parallax and peek yaw.
    syncOverlay() - Updates progress UI and body state classes, the controller hint, welcome, and CTA.
    updateNowViewing() - Throttled center-screen raycast that names the painting currently in view.
    _restartGalleryWalk() - Hides the end CTA and smoothly returns to the start.
    createCursorTrail() / tickTrail() - Initialize and animate the separate 2D cursor-glow canvas.
    ensureAudioCtx() / playFootstep() - Lazily create Web Audio and synthesize a muted-aware step.
    setupFilmGrain() - Generates one procedural noise tile used by the CSS grain animation.
    pickFrameAt(x,y) - Raycasts through nested frame meshes and returns their top-level frame group.
    bindLightboxClick() - Wires hover detection, frame clicks, and scroll-key blocking.
    bindMobileSwipeLook() - Maps deliberate horizontal gallery swipes to a persistent camera glance
      while leaving vertical scrolling, pinch zoom, dialogs, and controls untouched.
    openPiece(obj,isFirst) - Enters modal state, pauses scrolling/tour, saves camera pose, and focuses.
    focusPainting(obj,isFirst) - Tweens to a head-on camera view and fills lightbox text/actions/hash.
    _lbShare() / _lbNav(dir) - Share/copy a deep-link and browse frames with wraparound.
    _blockScrollEvt(e) - Prevents wheel/touch scrolling only while the lightbox is open.
    _galleryPeek(v) / _galleryMove(dir) / _galleryLook(dir) - Public bridges used by the earlier
      classic UI script. _galleryLook sets a turn DIRECTION (free look); _galleryPeek(0) recentres.
    _closeLightbox() - Clears modal/hash state and tweens back to the saved walk camera.
    createScrollTimeline() - Creates the ScrollTrigger, the velocity clamp/normalisation, and the
      master scrollProgress value used throughout the renderer. No scroll snap on any device.
    bindPointer() - Tracks normalized pointer/parallax, custom cursor velocity, and 2D/3D trails.
    bindCursorInteractions() / updateCursorVisuals() - Toggle hover states and paint cursor DOM motion.
    bindResize() - Debounces meaningful resizes, updates projection/render targets, and refreshes scroll.
    _adaptiveInit() / _adaptiveTick(now) - Optionally display the quality badge and dynamically lower
      or restore pixel ratio from measured frame rate (automatic and silent on mobile).

    RENDER / NAVIGATION / LIFECYCLE
    animate() - The central frame loop: moves camera, updates visible art/effects/audio/quality,
      culls distant frames, refreshes shader uniforms, and chooses postprocessed or direct rendering.
    _openFromHash() - Resolves #project-slug deep-links, retrying while async frames are created.
    openIndex() / closeIndex() / _toggleIndex() - Manage the works-index modal and scroll.
    buildIndex() - Creates one jump button per work from the same project-data array.
    setupLenis() - DEAD. The pinned Lenis CDN build 404s, so this returns on its first line and the
      page has always used native scrolling. See the block at its definition.
    raf(time) - Feeds Lenis from requestAnimationFrame. Never reached.
    _tourEase(t) / _tourScrollTo(y,seconds) - Provide easing and desktop/mobile scroll animation.
    measure(), done(), attempt(), step(), and cancel() - Small scoped helpers that respectively fit
      plaque text, confirm copied links, retry deep-link lookup, advance a mobile tour, and stop it.
    _startAutoTour() / _stopAutoTour() - Run or cancel the two-stage guided gallery walk.
    bindTourInterrupt() - Cancels the tour on deliberate wheel, touch, or navigation-key input.
    bindContextRecovery() - Stops safely on WebGL context loss and rebuilds render targets on restore.
    init() - Orchestrates scene creation, font/art loading, input binding, renderer startup, loader exit,
      and the opening fly-in. Its final catch activates the accessible fallback on failure.

    MAINTENANCE NOTES
    - Shared palette tokens live in :root and feed CSS, canvas effects, and the WebGL COLORS map.
    - Unused alternate layouts and legacy scene builders were removed to keep one tested corridor path.
    - Dialogs provide modal semantics, inert background isolation, focus trapping, and focus restoration.
    - Artwork textures stream around the camera and are released outside the wider retention range.

  // had; the other modes exist only for comparison and change nothing unless the flag is present.
  //
  // Why this exists: the gallery has no motion system on the walk axis. `scrollProgress` was the raw
  // scroll ratio and `updateCameraFromScroll` ASSIGNS the camera pose from it every frame, so the
  // camera is rigidly locked 1:1 to the browser's scroll offset — native scroll feel IS the
  // gallery's feel, and there is no constant to tune. (The ScrollTrigger `scrub: 1.5` looks like
  // damping and is not; with no linked animation GSAP creates no scrub tween.) Lenis, which several
  // comments credited with "the glide", has never loaded. Full write-up in
  // SETUP/gallery-navigation.md.
  //
  //   smooth              Lenis smooths the SCROLL itself. THE DEFAULT — chosen after a side-by-side
  //                       comparison of all three; it was the one that read as a museum walk rather
  //                       than a web page.
  //   native-current      raw ratio straight to the camera — the behaviour this page shipped with,
  //                       kept as the fallback and as the restore point.
  //   native-refined      native scroll, but a critically-damped follower between scroll and camera.
  //                       Measured better than native-current on every structural metric; kept
  //                       because it needs no library and is the safety net if Lenis ever has to go.

  // navigation: 12.58 SECONDS out of a 13.7-second fast-navigation pass.
  //
  // Two things were compounding:
  //   1. It read the full artwork canvas — 1000x1250 on desktop, 1.25 million pixels, a 5MB
  //      readback — to compute a single average colour. The loop then threw away 15 of every 16
  //      pixels anyway, so 78,000 samples were being paid for as 1,250,000.
  //   2. getImageData on a GPU-backed canvas is a synchronous GPU->CPU readback, and it cannot
  //      return until the GPU has drained its queue. This page keeps the GPU saturated, so every
  //      readback stalled behind a full frame of corridor rendering — hundreds of milliseconds each.
  //      Artwork streams in as the camera moves, so sweeping past paintings meant one stall per
  //      painting. That is precisely why the gallery was smooth standing still (59fps, zero
  //      readbacks) and collapsed while moving (7-15fps).
  //
  // 256x320 keeps the 4:5 aspect. The size was chosen by MEASUREMENT, not by guess: the accent for
  // all 51 artworks was computed both ways and compared channel-by-channel against the original
  // full-resolution sampling.
  //     96x120   median delta 2/255, p90 7,  worst 25   <- two warm-beige pieces shifted ~14% darker
  //     160x200  median 1,           p90 3,  worst 15
  //     256x320  median 1,           p90 3,  worst  6   <- chosen
  //     400x500  median 1,           p90 2,  worst  6   <- no further gain
  // A worst case of 6/255 is 2.4% on one channel of a halo tint that then has offsetHSL(0,+0.25,+0.08)
  // applied to it, so it is not a visible difference. Because the result is now cached per artwork
  // path, sample size costs essentially nothing — it runs at most 51 times in a session — so this is
  // sized for fidelity rather than for speed. willReadFrequently keeps the canvas in CPU memory.

  // ── Lightbox beam suppression — isolated to the focused piece ─────────────────────────────────
  // The white hotspot over the glass in the lightbox is TWO spotlights stacked, not one bad light:
  //   1. the artwork's own baked-in spotlight. Most of these pieces are dark studio renders lit from
  //      above, so the top of the IMAGE is already near-white before the scene touches it, and
  //   2. this room's volumetric beam, which hangs directly over that same region — the cone spans
  //      y 0.45..3.95 in the frame's local space while the painting only spans +-1.44, so its lower
  //      half sits right on the artwork's own highlight.
  // The cone is ADDITIVE, so the two simply sum, and bloom then smears the result into a flat blob.
  // In the corridor that never shows, because the beam is seen edge-on from metres away; the
  // lightbox camera sits 4.2 units out on the painting's normal and looks straight through it.
  //
  // The fix is the light, not the exposure: fade the focused piece's beam and hot bulb out while it
  // is open, so the artwork is lit by its own photography rather than by two suns. The corridor is
  // untouched — every other frame keeps its beam, and this one gets it straight back on close.
  // Each entry is the fraction of its normal opacity the element keeps while focused.
  //   cone/bulb  0    — the overhead beam and its hot bulb are the doubled light; they go entirely.
  //   heroGlow   0.45 — the hero's violet aura is 5.79 units tall behind a 2.875-unit painting, so
  //                     its top half hangs above the frame and adds to the same region. Halved
  //                     rather than removed: the aura is part of how the hero reads as the
  //                     centrepiece, and it is what keeps the glass looking lit rather than flat.
  // The per-painting halo (opacity 0.04, sitting BEHIND the art) is deliberately left alone — it is
  // an order of magnitude below the others and contributes no visible clipping.
  //
  // ?lbbeam=keep restores the previous behaviour (no dimming) so the two can be compared on a real
  // device — this could not be verified from a headless capture, which never reproduced the hotspot
  // at all. ?lbbeam=<0..1> scales how much is kept, for tuning: 0 is the strongest correction.
  // ── The actual hotspot fix: soften the frame's mirror while a piece is focused ─────────────────
  // Isolated by measurement, not assumption. Sweeping every layer against the hotspot box
  // (x 28-65%, y 8-32% of the frame, taken from the owner's annotation) gave:
  //     frameenv  -92.8%   frames -89.2%   env -93.0%   artonly -95.1%
  //     arch -0.2%   additive -2.5%   backhalo -2.5%   lights -2.1%   heroglow -1.5%
  // i.e. stopping the picture frame from sampling scene.environment removes essentially the whole
  // hotspot, while the walls, every additive layer, every light and the artwork itself remove none
  // of it. The frame material is chrome — roughness 0.16, metalness 0.96, envMapIntensity 1.1 — so
  // it mirrors the PMREM RoomEnvironment, a synthetic studio box with bright ceiling panels. At 4.2
  // units the lightbox camera catches that specular lobe square-on and bloom smears it into a blob.
  // In the corridor the same frames are seen at a glancing angle from metres away, so it never shows.
  //
  // It is NOT fixed by zeroing envMapIntensity: measured, that also drops whole-frame brightness by
  // 74%, and the brief was explicitly not to darken the lightbox. Instead the specular is SPREAD —
  // roughness up, intensity down — which turns a concentrated hotspot into a broad sheen with
  // gradation, exactly the "falls more naturally, visible gradation rather than clipping" ask.
  // The frame stays chrome; it just stops being a perfect mirror for the duration.
  //
  // Applied at FULL strength, and the ?lbsheen= scaling has been removed now that the value is
  // settled — one behaviour, no flag. The owner compared off / 0.3 / 0.55 / 1 on a real display and
  // chose full. Worth recording that headless measurement preferred 0.55, because full strength also
  // drops whole-frame brightness ~58%; on the actual screen full strength read better. The device
  // wins that argument, and this note exists so the 58% is not rediscovered later as a "bug".
  //
  // These numbers have to be this aggressive, and the reason is the important part: the reflection is
  // far ABOVE 1.0 before it reaches the screen. A first attempt at roughness 0.42 / intensity 0.55 —
  // halving the env contribution — moved the hotspot by 0.8%, because halving 3.0 gives 1.5, which
  // still clips to pure white; measured `peak` stayed pinned at exactly 1.0. Anything that only trims
  // the top of an already-clipped highlight is invisible. The value has to land below the clip point
  // to change anything at all. (?rolloff, the shoulder in the final blit, is the complementary tool:
  // it restores gradation to whatever highlight remains. It stays OFF by default.)

  //    1Hz — which this code cannot distinguish from a device rendering at 1fps. The gallery walked
  //    itself to the floor while nobody was looking at it, then showed a blurry room on return.

  //     1-second window, which then reads below 44 and descends again. Hence four descents in four
  //     consecutive seconds. _COOL_MS excludes the rebuild from the next judgement.
  //  2. A TRANSIENT WAS TREATED AS A VERDICT. A flick legitimately costs frames — the heavy-scroll
  //     bypass, a burst of texture streaming, Lenis catching up — and it is over in well under a
  //     second. Judging inside it descends for a condition that has already ended, and the quiet
  //     window afterwards then reads >52 and climbs back. That is the 59fps thrash above.

  //
  // THE BUG. The August anti-oscillation fix suspends judgement while the visitor is moving, and
  // every suspension throws away the partial sample. A measurement window needs one CONTIGUOUS
  // second of un-held frames. While someone is browsing, the longest un-held run is about 400ms —
  // so on a device slow enough to matter, NO WINDOW EVER COMPLETES and the governor never acts.
  //
  // Measured on an Iris Xe at 1638x944@1.75, CPU throttle 2, scrolling from a cold start:
  //
  //     30s of ordinary browsing:  0 windows completed, changes 0, win 0fps, STILL TIER 0
  //     stop touching it:          9 windows, descends 0->4 in 13 seconds
  //
  // That is full quality (2866x1652 at 4x MSAA) held on hardware managing 13fps, reported from a
  // real laptop before it was reproduced here. Reproduced identically with ?galrec=0 and =1, so it
  // is the hold, not the ascent experiment.
  //
  // _HOLD_MAX_MS was meant to prevent exactly this: four seconds of CONTINUOUS interaction and
  // judgement resumes. It never fires, because the reset below it zeroes the continuous-hold clock
  // whenever motion stops for longer than the 600ms tail — and a reading pause between two flicks is
  // always longer than that. Every pause hands the next scroll a fresh four-second budget.
  //
  // TWO PROTECTIONS, because neither is sufficient alone:
  //   1. _IDLE_RESET_MS — only a genuinely long idle restarts the continuous-hold clock. A short
  //      reading pause now counts as continued interaction, so the cap accumulates and fires.
  //   2. THE WATCHDOG — a backstop that does not depend on the cap timing being right. It measures
  //      raw frame pacing THROUGH holds (the one signal the bug cannot suppress) and descends if the
  //      device is genuinely struggling and no window has completed for a long time.
  //

  //
  // Why it exists. The descent side of this governor was fixed in August 2026; the ASCENT side never
  // got the homepage's two safeguards, and measurement found the consequence. On an Iris Xe at
  // 1512x982@2, unthrottled, the live gallery produced:
  //
  //     27 tier changes in 160 seconds, including a perfectly regular 17-change limit cycle:
  //     3->2 | 2->3 | 3->2 | 2->3 ...  every ~4 seconds, indefinitely
  //     68 MSAA renderbuffer allocations and 289 renderbuffer deletes in that stretch alone
  //
  // The arithmetic is not subtle. Tier 3 renders at effective DPR 1.1, tier 2 at 1.4, and MSAA goes
  // 2x -> 4x. That is (1.4/1.1)^2 x 1.25 = about 2.0x the frame cost. The governor measured 60.7fps
  // at tier 3, climbed because 60.7 >= 52, landed at roughly 30fps, dropped below 44 and fell back —
  // then repeated forever. It climbs into a tier it can never afford, every single time.
  //
  // The owner's own laptop did not show this because it sits at 47fps, inside the 44-52 dead band
  // where neither rule fires, so it is stable by accident rather than by design.
  //
  // Two mechanisms, both ported from index.html where they are already proven:
  //   1. AFFORDABILITY VETO. Do not attempt a tier this framerate cannot pay for. _tierCostRatio()
  //      is computed from the tier tables, so fps/ratio is where the higher tier would land; if that
  //      does not clear 44, the climb is refused. Skipped above _ASC_CLEAR because a 60Hz display is
  //      vsync-limited up there and the sample carries no headroom information to predict from.
  //   2. FAILED-PROBE MEMORY. A climb undone within _PROBE_JUDGE_MS proved that tier unsustainable
  //      here; do not retry it this session. Cleared by _adaptiveArm, because a tab or context
  //      restore means the situation changed and an old verdict is exactly what is wrong then.
  //
  // It also adds the slow ascent path, which is the "recovery" half: with only the >= 52 rule a
  // machine that steadies at 45-51 can never climb at all, which is the documented reason this page
  // gets stuck one tier below optimal. The veto is what makes adding it safe.
  //
  // THE TWO TEST URLS:
  //   ?galrec=1  new behaviour        ?galrec=0  current live behaviour (explicit rollback)
  // `=0` and no flag are the SAME code path — the parameter is read once, here, and every branch

  // Chosen after a measured side-by-side of all three navigation modes. What it fixes: without it,
  // `scrollProgress` was the raw scroll ratio and the camera pose was ASSIGNED from it every frame,
  // so a single wheel notch moved the camera 3.99m **in one drawn frame** and a large delta moved it
  // 46.55m in one frame. The travel did not move, it arrived. Lenis spreads the same journey across
  // dozens of frames, which is the difference between a web page and a museum walk.
  //
  // Read this before touching the numbers below:
  //  * This file used to load lenis@1.0.42 from a CDN and THAT URL 404s, so none of this ran for
  //    months while comments here described the glide as active. It is now vendored into Assets/.
  //  * `wheelMultiplier` cuts how far a given wheel input travels — measured 7.5x less reach per
  //    notch than native. That is deliberate (it is most of the "slow and premium" feel) but it means
  //    crossing the gallery takes proportionally more scrolling. Do not treat it as a free dial.
  //  * Lenis scrolls on the MAIN THREAD by design and installs a non-passive wheel listener. That is
  //    inherent, not a bug — and measured frame pacing with it was the best of the three modes
  //    (p99 21-22ms vs 116-177ms native). Do not "optimise" it away by making the listener passive;
