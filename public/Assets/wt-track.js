    /* ---------- click delegation ----------
       Intent is resolved from WHERE a click goes, not from what the button says.

       It used to be the other way round, and text matching had put three separate holes in the
       funnel:

       * "Get an estimate" — the primary CTA, appearing 26+ times across /pricing and all seven
         service pages, every one of them pointing at /start — matched no clause in the regex. The
         copies carrying `class="pricing-btn"` were caught by the class check; the copies using
         `class="cta-btn"` fell through to a CTAClick, which is not a funnel event. So four visually
         identical buttons emitted three different things depending on wording and class.
       * The four in-article links to /start inside blog posts fired NOTHING. No class, no matching
         text, and internal — so they missed every clause including the outbound one. Those are the
         mid-funnel clicks from the pages SEO actually lands on, and they were invisible.
       * ViewContent never fired from a listing page at all. `.case-card` and `.blog-card` are on the
         wrapping <div>/<article>, but this handler resolves e.target up to the nearest `a, button` —
         whose className is `case-link` or `blog-read`. The class test could therefore never match,
         on either listing page, since the day it was written. `closest()` is what it needed.

       rAF-gated, and it removes itself once the last threshold has fired.
       This file is loaded on both WebGL pages, where scroll IS the input device: the gallery's
       corridor walk runs on a ~1600vh runway and a held d-pad button writes window.scrollY every
       animation frame, so every one of those frames used to land here and read
       document.documentElement.scrollHeight — a forced synchronous layout inside the same frame as
       the Three.js render. index.html explicitly caches that same read elsewhere with the comment
       "reading scrollHeight forces a layout". Worse, after 90% the thresholds all short-circuit but
       the reflow kept happening for the rest of the session, doing no work at all. */
