/*
  Gallery project-data contract
  -----------------------------
  This is the gallery's single source of truth. Array order is display order. Each record supplies
  an artwork filename slug, category, title, description, and optional live URL. The final record is
  the centered KIASA hero; all earlier records are divided between the corridor's two walls.

  `acc` is the artwork's precomputed accent colour: the raw averaged sRGB triplet that drives that
  painting's halo, spotlight tint and frame uAccent. It used to be derived at runtime by drawing the
  image to a 2D canvas and calling getImageData(), which is a synchronous GPU->CPU readback — on a
  page that keeps the GPU saturated each call blocked for most of a frame, and because texture
  streaming reloads artwork as the camera moves it ran up to seven times per piece. Measured at 92%
  of all main-thread time during navigation. The value is a property of the image file and never
  changes, so it is baked here instead.

  Generated in real Chrome from the full-resolution file, using the same crop and the same
  midtone/saturation filter the runtime sampler used, so the numbers are what the browser itself
  produced. Do NOT hand-edit these. When adding or replacing artwork, re-bake it; a record with no
  `acc` still works — Gallery.html falls back to sampling that one piece at runtime.
